1. What is the correct null hypothesis for testing the relationship between attendance and test scores?
a) b = 0 (sample slope is zero)
b) β = 0 (population slope is zero)  
c) r = 0 (correlation is zero)
d) μ = 0 (mean difference is zero)
✓ Correct: b

2. The alternative hypothesis β > 0 suggests:
a) No linear relationship exists
b) A positive population slope  
c) Sample data shows increasing pattern
d) All students have higher scores
✓ Correct: b

3. Why was a two-sided test used for the spillage experiment?
a) Researchers expected both directions
b) No direction specified initially  
c) Data showed mixed results
d) Sample size was too small
✓ Correct: b

4. Which scenario requires β ≠ 0 in Ha?
a) Testing any linear relationship  
b) Expecting positive correlation
c) Checking for perfect correlation
d) Comparing two regression lines
✓ Correct: a

5. When should researchers choose Ha?
a) After seeing the scatterplot
b) Before collecting data  
c) When calculating t-statistic
d) Based on p-value magnitude
✓ Correct: b
