1. What is the correct interpretation of a 95% confidence interval for the slope of a population regression line?
a) 95% of sample slopes will fall within this interval
b) We're 95% confident the interval contains the true population slope
c) There's a 95% probability the true slope is in this interval
d) 95% of data points lie within this slope range
✓ Correct: b

2. If a confidence interval for slope includes zero, what does this suggest?
a) Strong evidence of a linear relationship
b) No evidence of a linear relationship  
c) The sample size was too small
d) The correlation is exactly zero
✓ Correct: b

3. For Raoul's propeller experiment (CI: 0.013 to 0.080), which conclusion is valid?
a) No relationship between rotations and flight time
b) Evidence of positive linear relationship  
c) Negative correlation exists
d) 95% of flights lasted between 0.013-0.080 seconds
✓ Correct: b

4. How should we interpret the Old Faithful CI (-0.55 to 16.13)?
a) Duration perfectly predicts wait time
b) Wait time decreases as duration increases
c) No conclusive linear relationship exists  
d) 95% of eruptions follow this pattern
✓ Correct: c

5. What does the confidence level (95%) refer to?
a) Percentage of data in the interval
b) Success rate of interval capture method  
c) Probability about specific interval
d) Accuracy of slope estimate
✓ Correct: b
