Sure, here’s a transcription of the video:

Daren Starnes, coming to you live from Hilton Head, South Carolina.
Welcome to the final unit of the AP Statistics course: Inference for Quantitative Data - Slopes

This is Topic 9.1, Introducing Statistics - Do those Points Align?

What will you learn in this video?

How can you determine if the slope of a sample regression line is consistent with random variation from a population regression model?

Let's start by looking at an example.

The Old Faithful geyser is the most popular attraction in Yellowstone National Park. People travel from all over the world to see this geyser erupt. The National Park Service helps visitors plan their time in the park by predicting when Old Faithful will erupt next.

The Starnes family took its first trip to Yellowstone National Park in July of 1995. We only had 6 hours in the park, but we were able to see Old Faithful erupt.

My wife and I returned to the park in July of 2019, and we wondered if the model used to predict eruptions of Old Faithful was still the same as in 1995.

This scatterplot displays data on the duration (in minutes) and wait time until the next eruption (in minutes) for all 262 recorded eruptions of Old Faithful in July 1995.

And we can see that there is a moderately strong, positive, linear relationship between duration and wait time in this population of Old Faithful eruptions.

And here we've added the population regression line to the scatterplot. Its equation is predicted wait time = 33.34 + 13.29 (duration)

Now the question is, what about 2019? So here's a scatterplot displaying data on the duration and wait time until the next eruption for a random sample of 25 Old Faithful eruptions in July 2019.

And here, we can see a moderately weak, but again, positive, linear relationship between duration and wait time in this sample of eruptions.

And here, we've added the sample regression line, so you can see the trend.

Uh, the equation of the sample regression line, predicted wait time is 62.95 + 7.79 (duration).

So, the big question is, is it believable that the population regression model from 1995 is still valid for predicting wait time from the duration of the previous Old Faithful eruption in 2019?

So here again is the July 1995 population with the regression model and our July 2019 sample of 25 eruptions gave us this sample regression equation, 62.95 + 7.79 (duration).

So we really need to estimate the probability of getting a sample regression line with a slope at least as surprising, or unusual, as 7.79 in a random sample of n=25 observations from the July 1995 population, because we're wondering if that model still applies in 2019.

Well, how do we figure that out? Let's start with the July 1995 population and let's actually simulate taking a random sample of 25 points from that population.

So we've done that with our computer. You can see the sample of points highlighted in red now.

And here are the points on their own scatterplot. So this is a simulated sample of size 25, and we can calculate these, uh, equation of that sample regression line, predicted wait time is equal to 28.74 + 14.46 times duration.

So the slope of this sample regression line is 14.46, which is not exactly the same as the slope of the population regression model was, but it's not too far from it.

So, we'll build this new graph as we continue simulating for the sampling distribution of the slope of these sample regression lines. Let's do another one.

Here's our population again from July of 1995. We'll simulate another random sample of 25 points.

Here they are in red and, and here is the, uh, scatterplot of these sample points with the regression line added.

And the equation, this time, predicted wait time is 39.27 + 11.97 times the duration. The slope, this time, is 11.97.

So we'll add that simulated slope to our dot plot. And we'll imagine that we continue this process, simulating random samples many, many times.

And we'll remind ourselves that we're trying to figure out if it's believable that the population regression model from 1995 still applies for predicting wait time from duration in July of 2019.

So, we'll keep doing that and we'll build up a simulated sampling distribution of the slope, which looks something like this blob of dots. It's got some pretty interesting features that we'll talk about later.

But remember, we need to estimate how likely it is to get a sample regression line with a slope at least as unusual as 7.79, the one we saw in July of 2019, in a random sample of 25 observations from the old population regression model.

Well, let's see where 7.79 is. It would be way off to the left end of this scale. We never once got a sample regression line with a slope that far from this, uh, center of the distribution.

So, our estimated probability is zero.

Let's translate that.

It's not believable that this population regression model from 2000, sorry, from 1995, still applies because there's an approximately zero probability of getting a sample regression line with a slope at least as surprising as 7.79 in either direction, uh, from the center, if the population regression model from 1995 is still valid.

So, what should we take away from all this?

Well, to determine if the slope of a sample regression line is consistent with random variation from a population regression model, you might take many random samples of size n from that population, by simulation.

Calculate the slope of each sample regression line. Build the simulated sampling distribution of the slope. And then see if the observed value of the sample slope can be explained by random variation or is, in this case, not.

So, I thank you for tuning in.

[00:00:03] Hello, AP Stat students.
[00:00:05] I'm Daren Starnes, coming to you from beautiful Hilton Head, South Carolina.
[00:00:10] This is the first video for Topic 9.2,
[00:00:14] Confidence Intervals for the Slope of a Regression Model.
[00:00:17] What will you learn in this video?
[00:00:20] Well, the biggest thing is, what conditions must the population regression model meet to obtain valid confidence intervals and significance tests for the slope?
[00:00:31] Second, how can we determine the shape, center, and variability of the sampling distribution of the slope of a sample regression line?
[00:00:41] Let's start by looking at an example.
[00:00:44] Those of you who tuned in for the first video will recognize the Old Faithful Still Faithful example.
[00:00:51] So, our family took our first trip to Yellowstone National Park in July of 1995.
[00:00:56] We only had six hours in the park, but we were fortunately able to see the Old Faithful geyser erupt.
[00:01:02] My wife and I returned to the park in July of 2019 and wondered if the model that was used to predict eruptions of Old Faithful was still the same as in 1995.
[00:01:13] And in the previous video, we used simulation to determine that the answer is no.
[00:01:20] So, the question then is, can we construct a confidence interval for the slope of the population regression line in 2019?
[00:01:28] To answer that question, we need to understand the connection between the population regression model and the sampling distribution of the slope.
[00:01:37] So, let's go back to 1995, where we have the entire population of eruptions for the month of July, all 262 of them are shown in the scatterplot to the right, along with the population regression model, predicted wait time is 33.34 + 13.29 * duration.
[00:01:56] In 2019, we had a random sample of 25 eruptions.
[00:02:01] And we've built the scatterplot along with the sample regression line, which has the equation predicted wait time = 62.95 + 7.79 * duration.
[00:02:13] We want to use the sample regression line to make an inference about the population regression model in 2019.
[00:02:21] And eventually, we'd like to construct a confidence interval for the slope of that population regression line.
[00:02:27] But before we can do that, we need to think about the conditions for doing so.
[00:02:31] So, we'll flip back to the July 1995 population, where we have all the data, and we'll imagine again taking repeated random samples of 25 observations, as we did in the first video, and each time calculating the equation of the sample regression line, ŷ = a + bx.
[00:02:50] And the question for us is, can we determine the shape, the center, and the variability of the sampling distribution of the slope, b, of the sample regression line based on this population regression model?
[00:03:03] We hope the answer's yes.
[00:03:05] So, here's the simulated sampling distribution of the slope that we built in the first video.
[00:03:10] And you can see some pretty interesting features about the shape and the center and the variability.
[00:03:18] In fact, the shape looks to be approximately normal.
[00:03:22] You wonder if that will happen in general, and we'll answer that.
[00:03:25] The center of this distribution, its mean is 13.29.
[00:03:30] And that number should look familiar.
[00:03:33] And the variability, measured by the standard deviation is 1.10.
[00:03:38] How are these characteristics related to the population regression model?
[00:03:43] Well, it gets a little bit complicated.
[00:03:46] The population regression model is of the form μy = α + βx, where μy is the mean value of the response variable y for a given value of the explanatory variable x.
[00:04:00] And if you refer to this visual, you can see that we have three different values of the explanatory variable x shown and the population regression model μy = α + βx.
[00:04:11] Now, confidence intervals and significance tests for the slope, β, of that population regression model have to meet some conditions.
[00:04:19] The first is that the true relationship between x and y has to be linear, not curved.
[00:04:27] The second is that the standard deviation of the y values has to be the same for all values of x.
[00:04:34] And the third is that for a particular value of x, the responses, or y values are approximately normally distributed.
[00:04:42] So, you can picture that with this visual, where you see these three normal distributions all having the same width straddling the population regression model, so they're centered on the population regression line.
[00:04:55] So, let's go back to the data from 1995 for the population of eruptions.
[00:05:01] Is the true relationship between x and y linear?
[00:05:04] Well, certainly the scatterplot looks pretty linear, and it's got a moderately strong positive linear relationship, as we mentioned in the previous video.
[00:05:13] And here's the residual plot corresponding to that population regression line, and we can see a fairly random scatter about the horizontal line with zero residual and no evidence at all of any leftover curved patterns.
[00:05:26] So, that condition is met.
[00:05:29] What about the second one?
[00:05:31] The standard deviation of y does not vary with the x values.
[00:05:35] So, as we move across the duration domain, we shouldn't see any obvious changes in the amount of variation around the line vertically.
[00:05:46] And we don't from the scatterplot.
[00:05:48] The wait times seem to vary by a similar amount.
[00:05:50] Now, don't get too caught up on the few observations in the middle.
[00:05:55] Focus on where the body of observations mainly is.
[00:05:58] Or we can look at the residual plot, which magnifies those deviations from the line, and we can see that the rough spread around the line is similar as you move across the domain.
[00:06:09] So, that condition is considered met.
[00:06:12] And finally, for a particular value of x, the responses are approximately normally distributed.
[00:06:17] Well, you really can't see that from this scatterplot.
[00:06:20] So, instead, we make a graph of the residuals themselves, that is, the prediction errors from the population model, and we can see a roughly symmetric, somewhat bell-shaped, and single-peaked graph that suggests approximate normality.
[00:06:37] So, everything's looking good.
[00:06:39] So, when those conditions are met, the sampling distribution of the slope has an approximately normal shape like the one we saw earlier.
[00:06:48] The center at the true slope of the population regression line.
[00:06:52] And the variability given by this formula.
[00:06:55] The standard deviation of that sampling distribution should be equal to, well, σ, which is the standard deviation of the residuals for this population regression line, the one that stays constant for all x values, divided by σx times the square root of n.
[00:07:10] So, for this population of data, σ = 6.47.
[00:07:15] σx is the standard deviation of the values in the x direction around their mean.
[00:07:22] So, that happens to be 1.18.
[00:07:30] And n is the sample size, so that's going to be 25.
[00:07:32] We took samples of 25 eruptions.
[00:07:35] So, let's run the numbers.
[00:07:37] The sampling distribution of the slope of the sample regression line for July of 1995, the shape is approximately normal.
[00:07:45] The center is 13.29, as advertised.
[00:07:48] And using the formula, the standard deviation is, look at that, 1.10.
[00:07:53] Those were the numbers that we provided before.
[00:07:56] Now, there's one little catch on the variability.
[00:07:58] We do need to check, since we're sampling without replacement, that the sample size is no more than 10% of the population size.
[00:08:06] So, here we had 25 eruptions out of the 262 available, and that is less than or equal to 10%.
[00:08:14] So, as we go back to 2019, here's the sample data with the scatterplot and the sample regression line.
[00:08:21] The question is, can we construct a confidence interval for the slope of the population regression line in 2019?
[00:08:29] Well, I guess we need to figure out how we're going to check the conditions about the population regression model for 2019 using only the sample data that we have here.
[00:08:40] That's not quite the same situation as we had in 1995.
[00:08:45] And another little problem, how can we estimate the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample slope, b, when we don't know the values of σ, the population standard deviation of residuals, or σx, the population standard deviation of x values?
[00:09:03] Those are two pretty big issues, and we'll be addressing them in the next video.
[00:09:08] So, what should you take away for now?
[00:09:10] Well, the conditions that the population regression model has to meet to obtain valid confidence intervals and significance tests for the slope are these three.
[00:09:18] True relationship linear.
[00:09:21] The standard deviation of the y values does not vary with x, and for any x value in the domain, the responses are approximately normally distributed.
[00:09:31] The shape, center, and variability of the sampling distribution of the slope will have these characteristics when the conditions are met, an approximately normal shape, the center at the true slope of the population regression line, and the variability given by this formula.
[00:09:46] So, this one was tough.
[00:09:47] Thank you for sticking with me.
[00:09:50] In the next video, we will connect that to the sample data for 2019.
[00:09:55] See you then.

### File: apstat_9-2-2_dialog.txt ###
[00:00:00] I'm Daren Starnes, coming to you from beautiful Hilton Head, South Carolina.
[00:00:05] This is the second video for topic 9.2, Confidence Intervals for the Slope of a Regression Model.
[00:00:11] What will you learn in this video?
[00:00:13] Two things.
[00:00:16] First, how do we identify an appropriate procedure for a confidence interval for the slope of a population regression line?
[00:00:24] And, second, how do we verify conditions for calculating a confidence interval for the slope?
[00:00:31] Hmm.
[00:00:31] Well, let's look at a familiar example from the first two videos.
[00:00:35] This is about predicting old faithful eruptions in 2019.
[00:00:40] You may recall if you've seen the earlier videos, that our family took our first trip to Yellowstone in July of 1995, and were fortunate with only six hours in the park to see old faithful erupt.
[00:00:51] My wife and I returned to the park in July of 2019 and wondered if the model used for predicting Old Faithful eruptions in the past from 1995 was still valid.
[00:01:02] And in the first video of this unit, we use simulation to determine that the answer is no.
[00:01:08] So we want to construct a confidence interval for the slope of the population regression line in 2019 if possible.
[00:01:15] Well, here are the data from July of 2019.
[00:01:18] We have a random sample of 25 eruptions and we've made a scatter plot of the duration and the wait time, and we've also calculated the sample regression line.
[00:01:27] Uh you can notice the computer output here from a least squares regression analysis gives the same slope, 7.79, and the same y intercept, 62.95, as is shown in the equation.
[00:01:40] So, how do we go about constructing a confidence interval?
[00:01:44] Well, first we better check that it's okay to do so.
[00:01:47] In the previous video we talked about the population regression model, and this visual summarizes uh what what is going on when the conditions are met for uh the population regression model.
[00:01:59] So we have the population regression line Mu sub y equals alpha plus Beta x, and then we have these three conditions that have to be met before we perform inference for beta.
[00:02:10] The true relationship between x and y has to be linear, not curved.
[00:02:14] The standard deviation of the y values has to be the same, represented by these same three sigmas uh on the normal curves, and the third, for any particular value of x, the responses or y values have to be approximately normally distributed around the regression line.
[00:02:32] When those conditions are met, we learned in the last video that the sampling distribution of the slope, b, of the sample regression line, has a shape that's approximately normal, has a center that's equal to the slope of the population regression line, Beta, and has a variability, or standard deviation, given by this complicated formula, as long as we don't sample more than 10% of the population.
[00:02:57] So, here's what the picture of what the sampling distribution looks like when the population regression model conditions are met.
[00:03:04] And, we define those symbols uh earlier, in a previous video, that Sigma is the standard deviation of the residuals around the population regression line, Sigma sub x is the standard deviation of x values in the population, and n is the sample size.
[00:03:19] We had some questions left over from the previous video.
[00:03:23] How do we check conditions about the population regression model using just the sample data you see here?
[00:03:30] And, how can we estimate the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample slope, b, using this formula, when we don't know the values of Sigma and Sigma x from the population?
[00:03:43] Well, in terms of checking conditions, we have to first be sure that the true relationship between x and y is linear.
[00:03:52] Looking at this scatter plot, the pattern has a linear form, not curved.
[00:03:58] Uh, it's not very strong, but it's definitely linear in form.
[00:04:02] We can also look at the residual plot to be sure that we see a random scatter of points about the horizontal line at zero and no clear indication of a leftover curved pattern of any sort.
[00:04:14] So that condition is satisfied.
[00:04:17] The standard deviation of the y values does not vary with x.
[00:04:21] Well, it's hard to tell with so few points, um, we can look at the scatter plot and see that there's a roughly similar amount of variation around the line at all the x values, or we can magnify it on the residual plot, and we don't see any clear evidence, with so few points, that the amount of spread around this horizontal line is different.
[00:04:42] So, we need to see clear evidence that a condition is violated before we say, "no good."
[00:04:48] And, the third one is that, for any particular value of x, the responses, or y values, are approximately normally distributed.
[00:04:55] Well, we need to make a graph of the residuals, uh in this case, a dot plot or maybe a histogram or something like that, uh we don't see any evidence of skewness or any clear outliers that would indicate departures from normality.
[00:05:11] Now, if we do see strong skewness or if we see outliers, that indicate nonnormality, we need to check that our sample size is greater than 30, or we can't we can't proceed.
[00:05:22] There are some additional conditions based on the data collection itself, that have to be met for inference.
[00:05:28] One is that our data need to be collected using a random sample or a randomized experiment.
[00:05:34] In this case, the data came from a random sample of 25 Old Faithful eruptions in July 2019.
[00:05:39] So that will allow us to generalize to the population of eruptions in that month.
[00:05:45] And, the other is, we need to be sure that we have independent observations.
[00:05:49] So when we're sampling without replacement, we need to check that we didn't sample more than 10% of the population.
[00:05:56] We knew that there were 262 eruptions in the month back in 1995.
[00:06:01] So assuming that's still similar, uh 25 would be certainly less than or equal to 10% of 262.
[00:06:10] So all of the conditions are met, which is good.
[00:06:14] And, now, the other question that we had left unanswered was, um if the conditions are met, how do we estimate the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the slope?
[00:06:25] We don't know Sigma, we don't know Sigma x.
[00:06:28] Well, maybe we can use the sample regression output to give us some information.
[00:06:36] The sample standard deviation of the x values is .213.
[00:06:41] And, we can use that to estimate the population standard deviation of the x values.
[00:06:50] If we look at the residual plot, the standard deviation of the residuals for the sample regression line is given by the slightly complicated formula.
[00:06:57] We call it s.
[00:06:59] It's the square root of the sum of the squared residuals, divided by n minus 2.
[00:07:04] And, that value is actually given down here in the computer output, 4.2097.
[00:07:11] That's the size of a typical prediction error, when we use the sample regression line.
[00:07:16] We'll use that value, s, to estimate Sigma, the deviations around the population regression line.
[00:07:25] So we now have an answer to that second lingering question.
[00:07:29] And, that means we're about ready to construct a confidence interval for the slope of this population regression line in 2019.
[

please continue

[00:07:37] The name of that type of interval is a t-interval for the slope.
[00:07:41] We'll get into the details of calculating it in the next video.
[00:07:45] So, what should you take away?
[00:07:48] Well, if you are wanting to calculate a confidence interval for the slope of a population regression line, you'd like to use a t-interval for the slope.
[00:07:58] Why a t-interval?
[00:07:59] Because we're estimating sigma with s.
[00:08:03] And how do we verify the conditions?
[00:08:05] Well, as you can see there are quite a lot of them.
[00:08:08] Most of the verifications of those first three conditions are based on looking at graphs.
[00:08:14] The last one is about how the data were collected.
[00:08:18] So we'll be using these conditions as we move forward, uh and start calculating confidence intervals in the next video.
[00:08:24] Thanks for tuning in.
[00:08:25] See you next time.

[00:00:00] Hello, AP stats students.
[00:00:01] I'm Darren Starnes, coming to you from beautiful Hilton Head, South Carolina.
[00:00:06] This is the third and final video on Topic 9.2,
[00:00:10] confidence intervals for the slope of a regression model.
[00:00:13] What will you learn in this video?
[00:00:15] Two things.
[00:00:16] How do you determine the margin of error when estimating the slope of a population regression line?
[00:00:22] And second, how do you calculate a confidence interval for the slope of a population regression line?
[00:00:28] Let's look at a familiar example from previous videos.
[00:00:32] The goal here is to predict the wait time until the next eruption of Old Faithful given data on the duration of the previous eruption.
[00:00:42] Here's a scatter plot showing 25 randomly selected eruptions in July of 2019, when my wife and I last visited Old Faithful.
[00:00:51] You can see the sample regression line added to the plot and the computer output here confirming the equation of the sample regression line, uh, as we'll see in a moment.
[00:01:02] We want to calculate and interpret a 95% confidence interval for the slope of the population regression line in 2019.
[00:01:12] So, you'll recall from earlier in the course that confidence intervals always have the form: confidence interval equals point estimate plus or minus margin of error.
[00:01:23] And the margin of error describes how much a value of a sample statistic is likely to vary from the value of the corresponding population parameter.
[00:01:34] So, what does that mean for determining margin of error?
[00:01:38] Well, two factors account for margin of error.
[00:01:41] One is how much the sample statistic typically varies from the parameter.
[00:01:46] And the other is how confident we want to be in our estimate.
[00:01:50] So, we can write the formula for margin of error this way: It's the critical value found from some distribution times the standard error of our statistic.
[00:02:02] How confident we want to be in our estimate determines our critical value.
[00:02:07] More confidence requires a larger critical value to multiply.
[00:02:11] And how much the statistic typically varies from the parameter is where the standard error comes in.
[00:02:17] So, let's translate this to slope.
[00:02:20] The standard error of slope is an estimate of the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the slope.
[00:02:27] Now, from Topic 9.2, earlier on, we saw the formula for the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the slope is given by this fairly complicated formula.
[00:02:37] Sigma sub b is equal to sigma divided by sigma x times the square root of n.
[00:02:43] But we don't know sigma or sigma x.
[00:02:45] Those are unknown population values.
[00:02:47] So, we use the corresponding sample values to estimate them.
[00:02:50] That is, we use the sample standard deviation of the residuals, s, to estimate the, uh, variability of the points around the population regression line, which we called sigma.
[00:03:02] And we use the sample standard deviation of the x-values, sx, to approximate sigma x, the standard deviation of the x-values in the population.
[00:03:11] So, we have our formula.
[00:03:12] The standard error of the slope is equal to s divided by sx times the square root of n minus 1.
[00:03:20] So, to calculate the margin of error, we need to also get the critical value, the multiplier we need to make the margin of error large enough to give us a specific amount of confidence that our interval will capture the true value of the parameter.
[00:03:36] For confidence intervals about the slope of a population regression line, the critical value will represent the boundaries that encompass the middle C, where C is confidence level percent, of a t distribution with degrees of freedom n minus 2.
[00:03:51] You've already used t distributions when doing inference about quantitative data for means, so they'll be familiar.
[00:03:58] Let's take a look at this for the Old Faithful scenario.
[00:04:02] We took a random sample of 25 eruptions from July of 2019.
[00:04:06] So, to find that critical value, we need to use a t distribution with degrees of freedom equal to 25 minus 2, or 23.
[00:04:15] So, here's a picture of what we're trying to find.
[00:04:18] We want to find these critical values, t star, and this would be negative t star, that cut off the middle 95% of the distribution.
[00:04:26] And the magic t star value, 2.069, is what we need.
[00:04:32] That value can be found either with Table B from the formula sheet for AP Statistics, this one here, uh, finding the correct number of degrees of freedom down, uh, in the chart here, 23, and then going across until you have the corresponding tail probability that you need for 95% confidence.
[00:04:52] So, that would be, uh, corresponding to the 2.069 number that you saw before.
[00:04:59] There's your 2.069.
[00:05:01] Another alternative is to use your calculator, uh, and do some sort of inverse T command on the calculator, using an area to the left of either 0.975 or 0.025.
[00:05:13] So, you can use, uh, old technology with the table or new technology with your calculator.
[00:05:19] However you get it, t star is 2.069.
[00:05:23] So, we're now ready to calculate the confidence interval.
[00:05:26] We use our statistic, which is going to be our sample slope, plus or minus our critical value that we just found, times the standard error of our statistic.
[00:05:35] In symbol form, we've got b, for the sample slope, plus or minus t star times the standard error of b.
[00:05:43] And here's the more complicated formula with the standard error of b written out.
[00:05:47] We already have our computer output from the sample regression line.
[00:05:52] And we can see that, uh, we have the slope of the sample regression line, 7.79.
[00:05:58] We have the standard deviation of the residuals from the sample regression line, 4.2097.
[00:06:04] We do not have the sample standard deviation of the x-values in computer output.
[00:06:09] But from the previous video, we found it to be 0.213.
[00:06:13] So, we can substitute those numbers into the formula along with the 2.069 that we found in the previous slide for the critical value.
[00:06:22] And we can see that our standard error for the slope is 4.03.
[00:06:29] Now, if you look back at the computer output, there's some really great news.
[00:06:31] It's given in the computer output.
[00:06:34] So, most of the time, you really won't need to mess with this, uh, pretty ugly formula.
[00:06:38] You'll be able to just pull it straight off the computer output and plug it in.
[00:06:42] Our margin of error is 8.34 after we multiply the critical value times the standard error.
[00:06:48] So, we've got our point estimate plus or minus our margin of error, and the resulting interval is from negative 0.55 to 16.13.
[00:06:59] Good news on the formula sheet.
[00:07:01] We can see that, uh, the confidence interval formula generically is given, uh, up here in area three.
[00:07:11] And further down in area three, we can see that the information about the sampling distributions for simple linear regression, in particular for the slope, the standard error formula for the slope is given over here in the right-hand column.
[00:07:28] What affects the interval width?
[00:07:29] Well, there are, uh, a couple of things.
[00:07:31] Uh, don't forget that the interval width is is twice the margin of error, because it goes out from the center, uh, in both directions.
[00:07:38] So, the margin of error was t star times standard deviation of the residuals around the sample regression line over sx times the square root of n minus 1.
[00:07:48] We would like to have our confidence intervals be as narrow as they can be to offer us more precision, to get a really precise estimate.
[00:07:56] So, in real research, there are two ways to get more precise estimate.
[00:08:01] And I bet you already know the first one.
[00:08:03] Take a larger random sample.
[00:08:06] Uh, the sample size n is in the denominator.
[00:08:08] So, increasing that value will decrease the fraction and therefore decrease the margin of error.
[00:08:14] Another option is to decrease the confidence level, say from 95% to 90%, and then you won't need as large of a multiplier to get your critical value to capture the middle 90% under the the t distribution curve.
[00:08:28] Let's do a quick practice.
[00:08:30] Here's a new scenario with Raoul performing an experiment using 16 windup rubber band single-propeller airplanes, like maybe some of you used as a kid.
[00:08:40] He wound up the propeller a different number of times and recorded the amount of time, in seconds, that the airplane flew for each number of rotations that the propeller was wound.
[00:08:49] And here's a regression analysis that was performed, and the partial computer output that you see here.
[00:08:57] Assuming the conditions for inference are satisfied, which of the following is a 95% confidence interval for the slope of the regression line that relates the number of rotations the rubber band is wound and the plane's flight time?
[00:09:10] And here are the options.
[00:09:12] So, what I'd love you to do now is pause the video.
[00:09:15] Figure out which one you think is the correct confidence interval, and then unpause the video, and you'll see what I have to say.
[00:09:26] All right, let's see what you got.
[00:09:28] The formula for the confidence interval is sample slope plus or minus t critical value times standard error of slope.
[00:09:36] The sample slope is given here, 0.04625.
[00:09:40] The standard error of the slope is given here, 0.01565.
[00:09:45] So, you can rule out a few choices already because not all of the choices have those two values.
[00:09:52] But you can't rule them all out but one.
[00:09:54] So, we have to go a little farther and think about the critical value t star.
[00:09:58] Well, the number of degrees of freedom, if n is 16, would be 16 minus 2 or 14.
[00:10:04] And the corresponding critical value, either from Table B on the formula sheet, or your calculator is 2.145.
[00:10:11] And now we have narrowed it down to one.
[00:10:14] Uh, the only option is choice A.
[00:10:17] So, I hope you got that one.
[00:10:18] What should you take away from this video?
[00:10:21] Well, it's not too difficult to determine the margin of error when you're estimating the slope of a population regression line if you have the computer output.
[00:10:30] You just take your t critical value times the standard error of slope.
[00:10:34] If you don't have the computer output, it's a little more tedious because you have to calculate the sample standard deviation of the x-values as well as the standard deviation of the residuals from the sample regression line.
[00:10:45] Once you have figured out your margin of error, the confidence interval is not hard to calculate at all.
[00:10:51] You just take your sample slope plus or minus your margin of error that you calculated, and you have your formula for the confidence interval.
[00:10:59] In the next video, we'll talk about how to interpret that interval and how to justify claims relating to that interval.
[00:11:04] Thanks for tuning in.
[00:11:06] See you next time.

Hello, AP stat students. I’m Mr. Starnes, coming to you from beautiful Hilton Head, South Carolina. Welcome back for Daily Video #1 of topic 9.3, “Justifying a claim with a confidence interval for a slope of a regression model.” What are you gonna learn in this video? How do we interpret a confidence interval for the slope of a population regression line? And second, how do we justify a claim based on a confidence interval for slope?

Let’s look at a familiar example, if you’ve been with me for a few videos. My wife and I returned to Old Faithful in July of 2019, almost 25 years from when we had taken our boys there the first time in 1995. We collected data on a random sample of 25 eruptions that month, and made the scatter plot you see here, adding the sample regression line, and producing the computer output from the least squares regression analysis. In the previous video we calculated a 95% confidence interval for the slope of the population regression line in 2019 for predicting wait time from duration of the Old Faithful geyser.

Now we want to interpret that interval. Remember, from what you’ve learned in the course already, that we interpret any confidence interval in a similar way. “We are blank % confident that the interval from blank to blank captures the…” parameter we’re talking about. In this case, the slope of the population regression line, in context. So, let’s practice with the Old Faithful scenario. In the previous video, we found that the 95% confidence interval for the slope was -.55 to 16.13.

So we would say, “We are 95% confident that the interval from -.55 to 16.13 captures the slope of the population regression line for predicting wait time until the next eruption (in minutes) from the duration of the previous eruption (in minutes) for all Old Faithful geyser eruptions in July 2019.” The context is sometimes wordy like this. When you’re interpreting the confidence level, you might remember that we’re talking about what happens if we were to repeat the random data production process many times in the same way.

In this case, if we repeated the random sampling with the same sample size, about 95% of our 95% confidence intervals created would capture the slope of the population regression line. So for Old Faithful, if we were to take many random samples of size 25 from the population of Old Faithful eruptions in July 2019, and we used each one of those samples to construct a 95% confidence interval for the population slope, about 95% of those intervals would capture the true slope. So remember there’s a difference between interpreting confidence intervals, like we did on the previous slide, and interpreting confidence levels like we’re doing here.

How about if we want to justify a claim of some sort? Does the confidence interval (-.55 to 16.13) provide convincing evidence that wait time until the next eruption of Old Faithful is linearly related to the duration of the previous eruption in July 2019? Well, note that a beta of 0 would indicate a… horizontal line, zero slope, is the model for predicting wait time from eruption duration in the population. In other words, the population regression model would predict the same wait time until the next eruption, no matter how long the previous Old Faithful eruption lasted.

So, that would be… not a linear relationship. Well, because our confidence interval contains zero as a plausible value of the slope of our population regression line, there is not convincing evidence that the wait time until the next eruption of Old Faithful is linearly related to the duration of the previous eruption in July 2019. That’s too bad. It would have been nice to be able to use a linear model to predict. So let’s practice with the scenario from the previous video. This was about Raoul, who performed an experiment using some wind-up, rubber band, propeller airplanes.

He did that a number of times, and recorded how long the airplane flew in seconds, for each number of turns that he did of the rubber band… uh, with the propeller. He did the regression analysis, and the conditions for inference were verified. The 95% confidence interval he obtained in the previous video was .013 to .080. And the question is, which of the following provides a correct interpretation of the confidence interval? So I’d like you to pause the video and try this one on your own, before I give you the answer.

All right, so… we’re interpreting the confidence interval. We uh, would like to say something like, “We are 95% confident that the slope of the population or true regression line, relating the number of rotations the rubber band is wound and the plane’s flight time, is between .013 and .080.” So it’s choice E. You might look back through each of the other choices, if you picked… uh, choice E, and just see why each of them is wrong.

That’d be a good review for you of some of the other misconceptions that… some of these multiple choice questions throw at you. Because looking through distractors on multiple choice, it’s a good strategy for… helping you avoid them on the AP exam. Let’s try just one more, about justifying a claim. So, it’s the same scenario… with Raoul and the rubber band propeller airplanes. Here’s the confidence interval that he got. “Which of the following conclusions is most appropriate based on the confidence interval?”

…while, this time… the confidence interval is… including only positive values. So that is a clear indicator… uh… of convincing evidence of a positive linear relationship between the number of rotations of the rubber band, and the flight times of windup airplanes like these, because all the values in the interval are positive. Again, I’d encourage you to take a look at… the other distractors to see… what it is about them, that’s uh, that’s tricky… uh, that isn’t quite right.

Uh, because looking through distractors on multiple choice, it’s a good strategy for helping you avoid them on the AP exam. So what should you take away from this video? Well, in interpreting a confidence interval for the slope of a population regression line, it’s just like interpreting… uh, confidence interval for any other parameter. Except you’re talking now about… slope of a population regression line. And… you can use a confidence interval to justify a claim, by looking and seeing whether that confidence interval… uh, includes… all values consistent with the claim as in Raoul’s experiment, or not as in the… uh, Old Faithful data collection from July of 2019.

So I thank you for tuning in. If you come back for the next video, you’ll see us go through a confidence interval for slope, from start to finish, like you might be asked to do on the AP exam.

[00:00:00] Students. I’m Darren Starnes, coming to you from beautiful Hilton Head, South Carolina.
[00:00:05] This is the final video for Topic 9.3 on justifying a claim with a confidence interval for the slope of a regression model.
[00:00:13] What will you learn in this video?
[00:00:16] Well we’re actually going to show you how to construct and interpret a confidence interval for the slope of a population regression line from start to finish.
[00:00:25] So let’s get right to it.
[00:00:27] This question comes from the 2019 AP Statistics International Exam. It was question number two.
[00:00:34] A real estate agent working in a large city believes that, for three-bedroom houses, the selling price of the house decreases by approximately $2,000 for every mile increase in the distance of the house from the city center.
[00:00:48] To investigate the belief, the agent obtained a random sample of 20 three-bedroom houses that sold in the last year. The selling price, in thousands of dollars, and the distance from the city center, in miles, for each of the 20 houses are shown in the scatterplot.
[00:01:04] The table shows computer output from a regression analysis of the data.
[00:01:11] There are two parts to this question. Part (a). Assume all conditions for inference are met. Construct and interpret a 95 percent confidence interval for the slope of the least-squares regression line.
[00:01:29] (b) Does the confidence interval contradict the agent’s belief about the relationship between selling price and distance from the city center? Justify your answer.
[00:01:40] What I’d like to suggest is that you pause the video here and work through the question as much as you can on your own. Then you can tune back in to see the model solution for this question.
[00:01:54] Alright, let’s look at part (a).
[00:01:57] This is where we’re going to construct and interpret the 95 percent confidence interval for the slope of the population least-squares regression line.
[00:02:06] So we want to do a 95 percent confidence interval for beta, which is the slope of the true, or population regression line for predicting selling price, in thousands, from distance from city center, in miles, for all the three-bedroom homes in this city.
[00:02:26] And we would like to use a one-sample t interval for that slope, beta.
[00:02:31] And, fortunately, we’re told in the question that the conditions are assumed to be met.
[00:02:37] So we can get right to the calculating part. The slope of the sample regression line is given here: -2.158.
[00:02:45] Now, for 95 percent confidence, we’re needing our degrees of freedom. They took a random sample of 20 homes, so our degrees of freedom would be 18.
[00:02:57] We can get the critical value from our formula sheet with Table B.
[00:03:03] Uh, so we just need to find our 28 degrees of freedom and our confidence level of 95 percent.
[00:03:10] And that would give us uh, 2.101 with tail probability .025 on either side.
[00:03:18] So we get 2.101. Again, you could do that with your calculator using the inverse-t command.
[00:03:26] So if you want to do it that way, you could do something like 2nd, variables, go to inverse t, tell it the area to the left of the place you want, either .975 for the positive value or .025 for the negative value.
[00:03:40] 18 degrees of freedom, paste that in, and you get 2.101 that way.
[00:03:46] Whichever suits you better.
[00:03:48] And then, to calculate the confidence interval, we’re going to take the sample slope, plus or minus t critical value, times the standard error of the slope.
[00:03:57] So we already have the -2.158 from the computer output.
[00:04:02] Uh, the standard error of the slope is given here, the .149, so we can plug that in.
[00:04:07] And then the 2.101 comes from the critical value that we found just a minute ago.
[00:04:12] So we can multiply those two together to get the margin of error being .313.
[00:04:16] And our final interval: -2.471 to -1.845. So it’s not too bad to calculate.
[00:04:27] Now we need to interpret that interval. I’ll put it here just to remind you what we got.
[00:04:32] And we would say, “We are 95 percent confident that the slope of the true regression line is between -2.471 and -1.845 thousands of dollars per mile.”
[00:04:46] This implies that for each additional mile that a three-bedroom house is away from the city center, the selling price of the house is expected to decline between $1,845 and $2,471.
[00:05:01] Now, let’s take a look at part (b).
[00:05:04] Does the confidence interval contradict the agent’s belief about the relationship between selling price and distance from the city center? Justify your answer.
[00:05:15] Well, remember that the uh, agent thought that the selling price of the home would decrease by about $2,000 for every mile increase in how far the house was from the city center.
[00:05:27] Remember, our interval we got was -2.471 to -1.845.
[00:05:33] That interval definitely includes -2, which corresponds to a $2,000 decrease.
[00:05:41] So because the confidence interval contains -2, corresponding to a $2,000 decrease, it is a plausible value for the slope of the regression line.
[00:05:50] Consequently, the data do not contradict the agent’s belief that the selling prices of three-bedroom houses decrease about $2,000 for every one-mile increase in the distance of the house from the city center.
[00:06:07] Just a comment in general. This is a very typical confidence interval question from the AP Exam free response.
[00:06:14] We had a part (a) that was focused on calculating and interpreting the interval, and then a follow-up, in part (b), justifying a claim based on our interval.
[00:06:24] You really need to be able to do all of these things because you could be asked to do so on the AP Exam.
[00:06:32] So what can you take away from this experience of going through a confidence interval from start to finish?
[00:06:38] Well, you always want to be sure to define the parameter you are trying to estimate.
[00:06:43] In our case, it was the slope of the population regression line. Identify the procedure you are using. We did a one-sample t interval for the slope, beta.
[00:06:52] Verify that the conditions for the procedure are met, and we got very fortunate, because we were told to assume that.
[00:06:59] Then calculate the confidence interval using your technology or your formula sheet where you need it.
[00:07:05] And then, interpret the interval in context.
[00:07:08] So, I want to thank you for tuning in. In the next video, we’re going to be focusing on how to set up a significance test about the slope of a population regression line.
[00:07:17] Hope to see you then.

### File: apstats_9-4-1_dialog.txt ###
[00:00:00] Hello, AP stats students. I'm Darren Starnes coming to you from beautiful Hilton Head, South Carolina. This is video one on topic 9.4, Setting Up a Test for the Slope of a Regression Model. What will you learn in this video? How do you state a null hypothesis in a test about the slope of a population regression line? And how do you state the alternative hypothesis in a test about the slope? Let's look at an example. This actually came from Dash Youngsaber in unit two, if you watched one of his videos. This is about schools and equal opportunity. And the question researchers posed was, can education systems equalize opportunities for lower income students?
[00:00:47] Here's a graphic that shows New York City and a study that revealed that higher poverty areas typically have lower attendance rates. Nationally, it's also true that higher income areas tend to have fewer chronically absent students. Some possible reasons for that are increased access to transportation for those students, and also not having to work to support their families, like some low income students do. We call this the income attendance gap. So one question we might ask is, can we improve scores of low income students by increasing attendance? Some school systems have targeted attendance as a key in trying to do that. So, if the model is that low income leads to low attendance, leads to low scores, maybe if we increase attendance, we can also increase the scores.
[00:01:40] So researchers in Texas designed a study to find out. They collected data on the percent of school days attended and number of questions answered correctly on the state's end of course Algebra I test for a random sample of 11 Texas Algebra I students. We're going to show you the data here, along with a scatterplot and computer output from a least squares regression analysis. You can see the regression line there on the plot. And the big question is, do the data give convincing evidence at the alpha equals 0.01 significance level of a positive linear relationship between state test score and percent attendance for all Texas Algebra I students? We know that we need to start our test by stating a null hypothesis. And from past units, you learned that in a statistical test, the null hypothesis is a statement of no difference, or no change, or no relationship, quite often.
[00:02:36] In this example, with attendance and test scores, the null hypothesis would be that there's not a linear relationship between these two variables, percent of school days attended and number of questions answered correctly on the Algebra I state test. So if that's true, if there's no linear relationship, that means you have a horizontal line for the population regression line with a slope of zero. And we can write it this way in symbols. The null hypothesis, beta equals zero, where beta is the slope of the population regression line for predicting number of questions answered correctly on the state test from the percent of school days attended for all Texas Algebra I students. Now, until we have convincing evidence otherwise, that's what we assume is true throughout our significance test. We assume the null hypothesis is true. What about the alternative hypothesis? Well, you know that from previous work in a test, the alternative hypothesis is the claim that researchers hope to support with evidence from their data.
[00:03:36] In this particular case, the researchers suspected that there's a positive linear relationship between the two variables, percent of school days attended and number of questions answered correctly. So, their alternative hypothesis is that the population regression line would have a positive slope. In symbols, we write it as H sub A beta greater than zero, and we've already defined what beta is. So a quick summary, you already know a lot about stating hypotheses, but for the slope of a population regression line, the null is typically a statement of equality suggesting no linear relationship. H null beta equals zero. And the alternative always contains a strict inequality. So we could have beta greater than zero, beta less than zero, or beta not equal to zero. When the inequality is less than or greater than, we call that a one sided alternative hypothesis. When the inequality is not equal to, we call it two sided.
[00:04:50] Remember that the choice of alternative hypothesis is determined by the researchers when they pose their question and should be stated before they collect data. It's no fair looking at the data afterwards and then choosing your alternative to suit your purposes. Remember never to refer to statistics like the slope of the sample regression line b in the hypotheses, and always remember to define your parameter. So let's practice. We've got a fun scenario here about two AP Statistics students who wondered about whether there's a linear relationship between speed and amount of drink spilled when driving on bumpy dirt roads. To find out, they designed an experiment where they filled a cup with 275 milliliters of water and placed it in the cup holder of the car. Then they drove down a bumpy dirt road at a specified speed and recorded how much water spilled out. They ran 25 trials of this experiment with five trials each at 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 miles per hour.
[00:05:36] Now here are the data from the experiment. You see five trials for each speed. Notice that several data points have the same value for amount spilled at that speed. So keep that in mind. Here's a scatterplot of the data, labeled with the number of repeated values, and the least squares regression output from an analysis from the computer. The question here, do the data provide convincing evidence at the 0.05 significance level of a linear relationship between the car's speed on a bumpy dirt road and the amount of drink spilled? Assume the conditions for inference are met. We need to state hypotheses. So what I'd like you to do is pause the video, state your hypotheses, and then turn the video back on and you can see how you did. All right. So as we state our appropriate hypotheses, our null hypothesis is beta equals zero, no linear relationship, and our alternative hypothesis is beta not equal to zero. The researchers did not specify whether they thought the amount spilled would increase or decrease as the speed of the vehicle increased. Here beta is the slope of the true regression line for predicting amount of drink spilled in milliliters from the car speed in miles per hour on a bumpy dirt road. How'd you do?
[00:07:01] What should you take away from this video? When you're stating the null hypothesis in a test about the slope, the null hypothesis is beta equals a specified value, usually beta equals zero, indicating a test of no linear relationship. Always remember to define your parameter beta clearly. When you state your alternative hypothesis, there are three possibilities. You might think that a positive linear relationship is the case in the population, beta greater than zero, or maybe a negative linear relationship, beta less than zero, or that there might be a linear relationship, beta not equal to zero. So that's it for this first video. When we come back, we'll check conditions for a test about the slope. Hope to see you then.

[00:00:02] Hello, AP stats students.
[00:00:04] I'm Darren Starnes, coming to you from beautiful Hilton Head, South Carolina.
[00:00:08] This is the second video on topic 9.4, setting up a test for the slope of a regression model.
[00:00:15] What will you learn in this video?
[00:00:18] First, how do you identify an appropriate significance test procedure for the slope of a population regression line?
[00:00:24] And second, how do we verify the conditions for performing a test about the slope?
[00:00:31] We'll look at an example.
[00:00:34] familiar from the first video.
[00:00:35] about schools and equal opportunity.
[00:00:37] We wonder if educational systems can equalize opportunities for lower income students.
[00:00:42] One problem is the so-called income attendance gap.
[00:00:46] You see this map of New York City that shows higher poverty areas tend to have lower attendance rates.
[00:00:51] And nationally, that's the case as well.
[00:00:54] Some possible reasons are that lower income students typically have less access to transportation and also may have to work to support their families, which makes their attendance less at school.
[00:01:05] So, we wonder if we can find a way to improve low-income students' attendance, if that will result in an improvement in their test scores.
[00:01:14] Some school systems have investigated this.
[00:01:16] So, if the model right now is low income leads to low attendance, leads to low scores, maybe we can break that cycle by increasing attendance, and therefore, increase the scores.
[00:01:28] Some researchers in Texas wanted to investigate this and collected some data from a random sample of 11 Texas Algebra 1 students about the percent of school days they attended and the number of questions answered correctly on the state's end-of-course test.
[00:01:42] Here are the data and also the scatter plot with the least-squares regression line added here and the computer output.
[00:01:51] And in the previous video, we posed this question: Do the data give convincing evidence at the alpha equals 0.01 significance level of a positive linear relationship between state test score and percent attendance for all Texas Algebra 1 students?
[00:02:07] In the previous video, we stated hypotheses.
[00:02:10] Here they are.
[00:02:10] The null hypothesis, beta equals zero.
[00:02:14] The alternative hypothesis, beta greater than zero, indicating a positive linear relationship.
[00:02:20] And beta was defined as the slope of the population regression line for predicting number of questions answered correctly on the state test from percent of school days attended by the Texas Algebra 1 students.
[00:02:33] Yeah, identifying the procedure for a test about slope is a new one.
[00:02:38] You've learned many different test procedures already.
[00:02:41] Some involved one sample, others involve two samples.
[00:02:44] Some were about categorical data for proportions or about categorical data for chi-square.
[00:02:50] Others involved inference about quantitative data for means and, more recently, inference about quantitative data for slopes.
[00:02:59] It probably won't surprise you to know that when we test a claim about the slope, we're going to use a procedure known as a t-test for a slope, just like when you did a confidence interval, it was a t interval for the slope.
[00:03:11] Now, as you know, checking conditions for performing inference about slope is a little unpleasant.
[00:03:16] I have to remind you about the conditions for the slope of the regression line that must be met in order for us to perform the inference.
[00:03:26] And there's a visual to help you be reminded.
[00:03:29] First and foremost, the true relationship between x and y, the two variables, must be linear, not curved.
[00:03:37] Second, the standard deviation of y should not vary with the values of x.
[00:03:42] It should be constant.
[00:03:44] And third, for a particular value of x, the responses, or y values, are approximately normally distributed.
[00:03:50] And you can see from this visual that at three different x values, we have the same amount of variability around the regression line, marked by sigma.
[00:04:00] We also have these normal curves at each of those x's representing the y values, and we also have the curve centered on the population regression line.
[00:04:11] We also needed there to be independence in the observations from the data collection.
[00:04:16] So, that required two checks.
[00:04:18] One, that the data are coming from a random sample or a randomized experiment, and also, when we're sampling without replacement, we need to check that our sample size is less than or equal to 10% of the population size.
[00:04:32] So, let's check for the data from Texas.
[00:04:36] First, we need to check the true relationship between x and y is linear.
[00:04:39] Here's the scatter plot, and you can see a moderately strong, positive, linear relationship between the two variables.
[00:04:47] We also have made a residual plot that shows a fairly random scatter about the residual equals zero line and no obvious curved pattern.
[00:04:56] Now, with 11 points, you might think you see a curve pattern, but don't stare at it for too long, or there's no pattern.
[00:05:03] So, that condition is satisfied.
[00:05:07] Next, we need the standard deviation of y to be constant across all the x values.
[00:05:12] From the scatter plot, it looks like the points deviate from the line by a similar amount throughout the domain.
[00:05:18] And from the residual plot, we don't see any clear evidence that the deviations from the line are any larger at any set of x values in the domain.
[00:05:28] So, this condition is satisfied.
[00:05:31] And finally, for a particular x value, we need the responses or y values to be approximately normally distributed.
[00:05:36] Remember, we check that with a residual plot, such as a dot plot of residuals or maybe a histogram.
[00:05:43] We don't see any strong skewness or outliers that would indicate non-normality.
[00:05:48] If we did, we would need to make sure the sample size was greater than 30.
[00:05:53] Checking the independence in data collection, our data did come from a random sample of 11 Texas Algebra 1 students.
[00:06:01] So, that's good.
[00:06:02] And we are sampling without replacement, but surely 11 is less than or equal to 10% of all Texas Algebra 1 students.
[00:06:08] I don't think we have any issues there.
[00:06:12] So, all the conditions are met, which means we're allowed to proceed with calculations in the next video.
[00:06:19] So, what should you take away as far as this video is concerned?
[00:06:23] First, the appropriate significance test procedure for the slope of a population regression line is called the t-test for slope.
[00:06:31] And verifying the conditions for a significance test about the slope is the same as verifying conditions for a confidence interval about the slope.
[00:06:40] True relationship between x and y is linear.
[00:06:42] Standard deviation of y does not vary with x.
[00:06:45] For a particular x value, the y values are approximately normally distributed.
[00:06:50] And independence in data collection, which requires random sampling or randomized experiment.
[00:06:55] And then, if we're sampling without replacement, checking that the sample size is less than or equal to 10% of the population size.
[00:07:03] It's not very pleasant, but we can do it.
[00:07:06] So, that's it for this video.
[00:07:07] In the next video, I'll be talking to you about how to do those calculations.
[00:07:11] Hope to see you then.

[00:00:00] Hello, AP Stats students. I'm Daren Starnes, coming to you from beautiful Hilton Head, South Carolina. This is the first video for Topic 9.5, “Carrying Out a Test for the Slope of a Regression Model.” What will you learn in this video? How do you calculate an appropriate test statistic in a test about the slope of a population regression line? And, how do we calculate a p-value in a test about the slope?

[00:00:26] Let's look at a familiar example from our previous two videos. Schools and “Equal Opportunity.” Can educational systems find a way to equalize opportunities for lower-income students?

[00:00:38] As this graphic suggests about New York City, it’s true nationally that higher-income areas tend to have fewer chronically absent students. Possible reasons include: access to transportation being more prevalent for higher-income students, and there being less of a need for them to work to support their family. So researchers wondered if we could break this pattern of poverty, leading to low attendance, leading to low scores.

[00:01:05] By finding ways to increase attendance for low-income students, and hopefully, increasing their test scores.

[00:01:12] Researchers in Texas collected some data from a random sample of 11 Algebra 1 students. On the number of, sorry, the percent of school days attended, and number of questions they answered correctly on the state's end-of-course test.

[00:01:25] Here are the data, along with the scatterplot, linear regression, and computer output.

[00:01:33] The question we’ve asked previously is, “Do the data give convincing evidence, at the alpha equals 0.01 level, of a positive linear relationship between these two variables, state test score and percent attendance for all Texas Algebra 1 students?

[00:01:48] Now, in previous videos, we’ve already stated our hypotheses. Null hypothesis beta equals 0, alternate hypothesis beta greater than 0, to represent a positive linear relationship.

[00:02:00] And we defined beta to be the slope of the population regression line for predicting the number of questions answered correctly on the state test from percent of school days attended for all Texas Algebra 1 students. We said we would use alpha equals 0.01.

[00:02:14] And, in the previous video, we identified a t-test for the slope as the correct procedure, and checked that the conditions are met.

[00:02:26] So how do you calculate a test statistic? Well, in this particular data set, we have a sample regression line with a slope of 0.57. That’s our “b” value.

[00:02:36] This gives us some evidence for the alternate hypothesis because the sample slope, 0.57, is positive. We want to know how likely it is to get evidence for the alternate hypothesis this strong or stronger by chance alone when the null hypothesis is true.

[00:02:54] Well, we verified that the conditions are met, so we can now calculate the standardized test statistic, using this formula from the formula sheet. Statistic minus parameter, over standard error of the statistic. For the t-test for a slope, the standardized test statistic is “t” equals the sample slope, minus the null value from the null hypothesis, beta naught, divided by the standard error of the slope. And from our computer output, we can see that the sample slope, 0.57, minus the null value of 0, divided by the standard error of the slope, 0.062, and that gives us a t-statistic of 9.19.

[00:03:36] Now here’s a little shortcut. If you look at the “t” column next to the “attendance” row, that’s very close to the 9.18 value that you find there. The difference is due to rounding. So 9.18 or 9.19 are our t-statistic, and you can just read it off the computer output. But we want you to know how it’s obtained. Calculating the test statistic is really just a matter of referring to your formula from the formula sheet, and then remembering which type of inference you’re doing. In this case, inference about the slope of the regression line. And there’s the formula for the standard error, should you need it. Which you hope is that you get computer output and that you won’t need it, you can just look at the output.

[00:04:17] How do you get the p-value? Well, like with the confidence intervals, we use a t-distribution, with degrees of freedom equal to sample size minus 2. And the p-value represents the proportion of values that are as extreme or more extreme than the observed value of the test statistic, in this case, t = 9.18. Because our alternate hypothesis is one-sided, we only are looking for evidence of a positive slope. We want to find this probability, t greater than or equal to 9.18, in a t-distribution with degrees of freedom equal to the number of points, 11, minus 2, which is 9. So here’s a picture. This is the t-distribution centered at 0. And here’s 9.18, way out to the right. So the probability of getting a standardized value that far away from 0 is very, very small.

[00:05:08] Using the tables, the p-value would be less than 0.0005 for this one-sided test. And with technology, like your calculator, the p-value is 3.63 times 10 to the negative 6. You’ll also notice in the computer output, there is a p-value column next to the attendance row, and that is the p-value for a two-sided test. So if you want to use that value, you need to split it in half for a one-sided test. In this case, we’re still going to get about 0.

[00:05:38] Let’s practice with a scenario from a previous video about spilling your drink when you drive on a bumpy dirt road. Two students designed an experiment, filling a cup with 275 milliliters of water for each trial, and placing it in the car’s cup holder. Then they drove down a bumpy dirt road at a randomly assigned speed and recorded how much water spilled out. They had 5 trials each at 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 miles an hour. Here’s a scatterplot of the data. Notice, there are some repeated values on the scatterplot, and also the least-squares regression output. And our question from before, “Do the data provide convincing evidence, at the 0.05 level, of a linear relationship between the car’s speed on a bumpy dirt road, and the amount of drink spilled?” We’re told to assume conditions for inference are met.

[00:06:49] In a previous video, we have already found the hypotheses, and the conditions are assumed met, so we can now proceed with the calculation. Why don’t you pause the video and see if you can calculate the standardized test statistic and p-value, and then resume the video and see if you got the same answer I did. So in the previous video, we stated the null hypothesis and the alternate hypothesis, and we defined the slope. And we said to use alpha equals 0.05 in the question, and we said to use a t-test for the slope.

[00:07:07] Now to do our calculations, we have a sample slope of 1.520. Reminding you of the hypotheses, that’s the null value, beta equals 0. We get 1.520 minus 0 over 0.179. Now, notice, I was not very nice on my computer output. I did not give you the column for “t” or for the “p-value.” Not nice. But you can still calculate the t-statistic is 8.49. Finding the p-value, on a two-sided test means that you need to find the probability of getting a t-statistic either less than or equal to negative 8.49 or greater than or equal to 8.49, on a t-distribution with degrees of freedom equal to 25 minus 2, or 23. So here’s our picture again. 8.49 and negative 8.49 are so far from 0 that it’s just not very likely to get values so extreme. So, with Table B, the best we can do is, the p-value is less than 2 times 0.0005, which would be less than 0.001. And with technology, the p-value is 1.52 times 10 to the negative 8. Pretty darn small.

[00:08:51] So what should you take away from this video? First, calculating the test statistic in a test about the slope is fairly straightforward if you have computer output that provides it. Otherwise, you can use the formula: t equals b, minus beta sub 0, the null value of the slope, over the standard error of the slope. And for the p-value, you just need to see if you have a one-sided test, or if you have a two-sided test, as in our “Let’s Practice” illustration, and then find the p-value using the table or technology. Always use a t-distribution with n-2 degrees of freedom. Thanks for tuning in. In the next video, we’re going to

[00:00:00] Students. I'm Daren Starnes, coming to you from beautiful Hilton Head, South Carolina.
[00:00:05] This is the second video on topic 9.5, carrying out a test for the slope of a regression model.
[00:00:11] What will you learn in this video? First, how do you interpret the P value in a test about the slope of a population regression line?
[00:00:20] And second, how do we state a conclusion in a test about the slope?
[00:00:24] Let's look at a familiar example from the previous videos.
[00:00:28] It's about schools and equal opportunity.
[00:00:31] The big question is whether educational systems can equalize opportunities for lower income students.
[00:00:37] This visual from New York City shows that higher poverty areas in general tend to have lower attendance rates.
[00:00:44] That's true throughout the country, higher income areas tend to have fewer chronically absent students, perhaps because they have better access to transportation or they don't have to work to support their families like some low income students do.
[00:00:58] Researchers wondered if attendance might be the solution.
[00:01:02] If they could develop policies and systems to support lower income students increasing attendance, and if that would result in increased scores.
[00:01:13] So some researchers in Texas decided to find out.
[00:01:16] They took a random sample of 11 Algebra 1 students in Texas and recorded the percent of school days attended and the number of questions answered correctly on the state's end of course test.
[00:01:28] Here are the data along with a scatterplot or regression line, and a least-squares regression analysis from computer output.
[00:01:36] The question we've been asking is, do these data give convincing evidence at the alpha equals 0.01 significance level of a positive, linear relationship between state test score and percent attendance in the population of Texas Algebra 1 students?
[00:01:51] So far, in previous videos we've stated hypotheses.
[00:01:55] Our null was beta equals 0.
[00:01:57] Our alternative was beta greater than 0 to test for a positive linear relationship in the population.
[00:02:03] And we defined the slope beta as the slope of the population regression line for predicting the number of questions answered correctly on the state test from the percent of school days attended for all the Texas Algebra 1 students.
[00:02:16] We're using alpha equals 0.01 and we identify that procedure as a t test for slope, and we checked that the conditions were met.
[00:02:25] In the most recent video, we calculated the standardized test statistic, t equals 9.18 and a P-value of approximately 0 to three decimal places, using our slope of our sample regression line of 0.57.
[00:02:39] And we said that that sample regression line slope of 0.57 is evidence against the null hypothesis of no linear relationship and for the alternative hypothesis of a positive linear relationship, because obviously 0.57 is greater than 0.
[00:02:54] Now the P-value measures how likely it is to get evidence for the alternative hypothesis as strong as or stronger than the observed evidence from the study, by chance alone, when the null hypothesis is true.
[00:03:07] So in this case, assuming that there is no linear relationship between state test score and percent attendance for Texas Algebra 1 students, there is an approximately 0 probability of getting a sample regression line with a slope of 0.57 or greater by chance alone in a random sample of 11 Texas students.
[00:03:28] Well, you'll remember from the past when you're making a conclusion in a test, a small P value means the test statistic is unlikely to occur by random chance alone, whereas larger P values suggest the test statistic is not unlikely to occur by random chance.
[00:03:43] And that guides your conclusion.
[00:03:46] If the P value is small, then we say because the P value of whatever is less than or equal to the alpha value, we reject the null hypothesis.
[00:03:53] And we state that there is convincing statistical evidence for HA in context.
[00:03:58] If the P value is larger than alpha, we fail to reject the null hypothesis and we state that there is not convincing statistical evidence that the alternative hypothesis is correct.
[00:04:10] What about in this case? Well, we're recapping all of the things from the previous videos once again, and with that P-value of approximately 0, which is less than our stated alpha of 0.01, we reject the null hypothesis.
[00:04:24] There is convincing statistical evidence of a positive, linear relationship between state test score and percent excuse me, percent attendance for all the Texas Algebra 1 students.
[00:04:34] So let's practice with a scenario from a couple of videos past, called Don't spill my drink.
[00:04:41] Remember that two AP Statistics students designed an experiment to see if there's a linear relationship between speed on a dirt road with bumps and amount of drink spilled.
[00:04:52] To find out, they filled a cup with 275 ml of water each time and placed it in the car's cup holder before driving down a bumpy dirt road at a randomly assigned speed and then recorded how much water spilled out.
[00:05:05] They did five trials each at 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 mph in a random order.
[00:05:09] And here is a scatter plot of the data along with a reduced version of the computer output from a least-squares regression analysis.
[00:05:18] And we asked the question before of whether these data provide convincing evidence at the 0.05 significance level of a linear relationship between the two variables, the car's speed on a bumpy dirt road and the amount of drink spilled.
[00:05:31] And we were told to assume the conditions for inference are met.
[00:05:35] So a quick recap from the previous videos.
[00:05:37] Uh, we stated hypotheses.
[00:05:39] This time the alternative is beta not equal to 0, because the student researchers didn't have an idea of whether more or less would spill out as they drove across the bumpy road.
[00:05:48] T test for slope was the method.
[00:05:52] And we calculated in the previous video that T was 8.49 and the P value 1.52 * 10^-8.
[00:05:59] Why don't you try to interpret the P-value?
[00:06:01] Just pause the video, write out your interpretation, and then resume the video and see how you did.
[00:06:09] We would say, assuming that there is no linear relationship between the car's speed on a bumpy dirt road and the amount of drink spilled, there is a 1.52 * 10^-8 probability of getting a sample regression line with a slope as extreme as or more extreme than 1.52 in either direction by chance alone.
[00:06:30] How'd you do on that one? And now we're ready to make the conclusion.
[00:06:34] Again, why don't you try pausing the video, writing out your conclusion, and then you can resume to see how you did.
[00:06:43] Recapping once again from the previous videos, most recently t = 8.49 and p-value 1.52 * 10^-8.
[00:06:53] We would say because the p-value of 1.52 * 10^-8 is less than our stated alpha of 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis.
[00:07:01] There is convincing statistical evidence of a linear relationship between the car's speed on a bumpy dirt road and the amount of drink spilled.
[00:07:10] What should you take away from this video? In interpreting a P value in a test about the slope, it measures how likely it would be to get evidence for the alternative hypothesis as strong as or stronger than the observed evidence from the study, by chance alone, when the null hypothesis is true.
[00:07:26] Just be sure to pay attention to whether you have a one sided or two sided alternative hypothesis.
[00:07:32] And when you state your conclusion, follow the rules you've been using for significance tests.
[00:07:37] If the P value is less than or equal to alpha, reject the null because there's convincing evidence for the alternative.
[00:07:43] If the P value is greater than alpha, fail to reject the null and state that there's not convincing statistical evidence for the alternative.
[00:07:51] Well, thank you for tuning in.
[00:07:53] In the next video, we'll take you through a test about the slope from start to finish

[00:00:00] Introduction

"Hello, AP stats students. I'm Darren Starnes, coming to you from beautiful Hilton Head, South Carolina. This is video 3 in topic 9.5, carrying out a test for the slope of a regression model."

[00:00:14] What Will You Learn?

"What will you learn in this video? Well, we're going to go through a complete significance test about the slope of a population regression line, using everything you've learned to this point."

[00:00:25] Let's Practice

"Let's practice."

The speaker introduces a modified version of question 6 from the 2001 AP Statistics exam.

[00:00:35] Exam Question Scenario

The Statistics Department at a large university is trying to predict whether applicants will successfully complete a Ph.D. program.

They are considering GPA (grade point average) in undergraduate statistics and mathematics courses (a measure of performance) and mean credit hours per semester (a measure of workload) as potential predictors.

A random sample of 20 entering students from the past 5 years is taken.

[00:01:09] Data Tables

Data is presented for 13 students who successfully completed the Ph.D. program (Students A-M).

Data is presented for 7 students who did not complete the Ph.D. program (Students N-T).

Both tables show GPA and Credit Hours.

[00:01:21] Regression Output (Did Not Complete Ph.D.)

Regression output is shown for the 7 students who did not complete the Ph.D. program.

The residual plot (not shown) indicated no unusual patterns, and assumptions for inference were judged reasonable.

The output table will be used for the test.

[00:01:44] Part (a) of the Question

"For the students who did not complete the Ph.D. program, is there a significant relationship between GPA and mean number of credit hours per semester at the alpha = 0.01 level?"

The speaker suggests pausing the video to attempt a solution.

[00:02:12] Model Solution for Part (a) - Stating Hypotheses

H0 (Null Hypothesis): β = 0 (No linear relationship)

Ha (Alternative Hypothesis): β ≠ 0 (There is a linear relationship)

Where β is: the slope of the population regression line for predicting mean number of credit hours per semester from GPA for students who did not complete the statistics Ph.D. program at this large university.

The speaker notes that although the question doesn't specify linear, that is the only possible relationship being talked about.

[00:03:14] Significance Level and Procedure

α = 0.01

Procedure: t-test for slope. Conditions are met.

[00:03:31] Calculations

The t-statistic from the computer output is -3.44.

Because Ha: β ≠ 0, this is a two-tailed test. We need to find P(t ≤ -3.44) + P(t ≥ 3.44).

Degrees of freedom (df) = 7 - 2 = 5

The p-value = 0.018

[00:04:18] Conclusion

Because the p-value (0.018) > α (0.01), we fail to reject the null hypothesis (H0).

"There is not convincing evidence of a linear relationship between GPA and mean number of credit hours in the population of students at this university who did not complete the statistics Ph.D. program."

[00:04:46] Part (b) of the Question

New regression output is shown, this time for the 13 students who did successfully complete the Ph.D. program.

The residual plot (not shown) again indicated no unusual patterns and reasonable assumptions.

"For the students who successfully completed the Ph.D. program, is the evidence for a significant (linear) relationship between GPA and mean number of credit hours per semester stronger or weaker than for the students who did not complete the Ph.D. program? Justify your answer."

The speaker notes it's not necessary to carry out a full significance test for part (b); the computer output provides enough information. He encourages pausing again.

[00:05:48] Model Solution for Part (b)

"Stronger."

The p-value for the test of H0: β = 0 vs. Ha: β ≠ 0 (using the same definition of β as before, but now for successful students) is approximately 0.000.

This p-value is smaller than the 0.018 p-value from part (a), and thus gives stronger evidence of a significant relationship between GPA and mean number of credit hours per semester.

The speaker explains that you can come to the same answer by comparing the t-statistic, which is more extreme in the second case.

[00:06:54] Key Takeaways

The steps of a complete significance test for the slope of a population regression line:

State the null and alternative hypotheses, and define the parameter.

Give the significance level.

Identify the procedure (t-test for slope).

Verify the conditions.

Calculate the test statistic and p-value.

Make a conclusion based on the p-value (don't interpret the p-value unless specifically asked).

The video emphasizes how to correctly perform a full significance test, to interpret a t-test, to work with p-values, and how to address exam questions.

[00:00:00] Stat students, I'm Daren Starnes coming to you from beautiful Hilton Head, South Carolina. This is the final video in AP Daily for AP Statistics. You've made it to the end. Congratulations. Topic 9.6, skills focus, selecting an appropriate inference procedure. What will you learn in this video? First, what inference methods did you learn about in units six through nine? And second, how can you identify the appropriate inference procedure to use in a given setting on the AP exam? Let's do an inference recap. Remember that there are two main goals of inference. If you're trying to estimate a parameter, you use a confidence interval. If you're trying to test a claim, you do a significance test. Also remember that the appropriate inference method depends on the type of data. So in unit six, you did inference for categorical data, one or two proportions. In unit seven, inference for quantitative data, one or two means. In unit eight, inference for categorical data, chi square, and in unit nine, inference for quantitative data, slopes. On confidence intervals, the formula on the formula sheet is the same for all procedures. Statistic plus or minus the critical value from an appropriate distribution times the standard error of the statistic. You should always do these steps. Define the parameter you want to estimate, identify the inference procedure, verify conditions, calculate the interval and interpret the interval in context. You do not need to interpret the confidence level unless you're specifically asked. Now you probably will be asked to do so at some point on the AP exam. How about significance tests? Well, the formula on the formula sheet, standardized test statistic equals statistic minus parameter over standard error of the statistic. The steps are similar. We start by stating null and alternative hypotheses, and be sure to define any parameters. Give your significance level. Identify the inference procedure. Verify conditions. Calculate the test statistic and P value and then make a conclusion based on the P value. You don't need to interpret that P value unless you're specifically asked and you likely will be asked to do so somewhere on the AP exam. Here's a slide that summarizes all of unit six, the four different inference procedures you learned, their goal, the method, the name, the formula and the conditions that you need to check. I encourage you to refer back to these slides for each unit after the video. Here are the ones for unit seven, where you're doing inference about quantitative data for means. Just a note, one sample methods also include inference about a mean when you have paired data. Here's unit eight, inference for categorical data, chi square. Remember the three types of chi square depend on the goal of the test. Whether you have one variable or whether you have two variables that you're studying and how the data were collected. And for unit nine, inference for quantitative data about slopes. We can estimate a slope or we can test a claim about the slope. The conditions there are the most challenging of all. There are so many to deal with and they're very hard to check. How do you select the right inference procedure? Well, let's consider those units. Categorical data for proportions, we have these four we might choose. Quantitative data for means. We have these four we might choose. Categorical data for chi square, we have these three, and quantitative data for slopes, we have these two. So, just in a quick count, we have 13. Lucky 13 inference procedures. Now, just to an aside, if you count the paired data procedures, uh, under quantitative data for means as separate, then you can get to 15 if you don't like 13. Let's look at an example. This is from the 1997 AP exam question number five. A company bakes computer chips in two ovens, oven A and oven B. The chips are randomly assigned to an oven and hundreds of chips are baked each hour. The percentage of defective chips coming from these ovens for each hour of production throughout a day is shown below. Here's the table. The percentage of defective chips produced each hour by oven A has a mean of 33.56 and a standard deviation of 5.20. The percentage of defective chips produced each hour by oven B has a mean of 32.44 and a standard deviation of 3.78. The hourly differences in percentages for oven A minus oven B have a mean of 1.11 and a standard deviation of 4.28. Does there appear to be a difference between oven A

[00:04:59] and oven B with respect to the mean percentages of defective chips produced? Give appropriate statistical evidence to support your answer. So we're trying to identify the correct inference method. Why don't you start with thinking about what each individual or case in the data set represents. Here, it's a batch of chips produced in an hour in one of these two ovens. The variable of interest that we're measuring on that batch of chips is the percentage that are defective. And that's a quantitative variable, the percent defective out of a batch. So we want to do inference about quantitative data here for means. The mean percentage is mentioned in the question. And so we know we're in this column from unit seven. All we need to do is narrow it down from there. Do we have one sample, paired data or two samples? Well, here, the data are paired by hour. The batch is made in hour four in oven A and oven B may be impacted by the fact that it's the fourth hour of production and so on for the other hours. So we have paired data. And finally, is our goal to estimate a parameter or to test a claim? Based on the question, does there appear to be a difference? That sounds like testing a claim. So from the four options, we need to do a one sample t test for a mean with paired data. Some people like to call this a paired t test. So that's a process we can use to select the right inference procedure. And that's really important if you're going to have to do a free response question, because if you get off on the wrong foot, you may not earn very much credit using the incorrect procedure. So let's practice. This is a wonderful resource as you get prepared for the AP exam developed by Larry Green of Lake Tahoe Community College. At his site, you can get a randomly selected research question and then you can choose which of the inference procedures is the appropriate one to use, exactly the skill we're trying to develop. Here's one about whether political affiliation related to the month that the person was born in? 3000 voters were studied. So let's go through our process and individual or case here in the data set would be a voter. You can almost picture the spreadsheet of the data and just think about what each row would have on it. It's one voter. And what did they record about that voter? They recorded the birth month and they recorded the voter's political affiliation. So we have two variables. Those variables are both categorical, puts their values into categories. So we want to do inference for categorical data, chi square, because we have the relationship between two categorical variables. Well on our chart that puts us in unit eight. We just need to figure out which of the three chi square tests is appropriate in this case. So are we dealing with one variable, two variables coming from one sample or two variables coming from multiple samples or treatments in an experiment. What says that we're 3000 voters studied. So that's just one sample of voters. Two variables. And that means we want a chi square test for independence shown here on our unit eight chart. What should we take away from this video? Well, you learned a lot of inference methods in units six through nine. Feel free to come back to the video and look at those summary charts for each of the four units. And how can we identify the appropriate inference procedure to use in a given setting? Find the individual or case in the data set. Imagine the data spreadsheet. Identify the variable or variables of interest that are recorded for each individual or case. Categorize the type of data as categorical or quantitative, and figure out whether you're doing inference uh, for a mean or a proportion or a chi square or a slope, and also whether you're trying to estimate or test a claim. So I want to thank you on behalf of all of the AP
